       <ul class="about1">
      <li> We use the power of the Internet to connect adopters 
        with shelter pets and help pets go from alone to adopted.</li>
        <li>Our effort is to save pets stranded on streets. </li> 
<li>We are honest and forth coming about all of our dogs we place for adoption. </li>
<li>We, for the life of the pet, will be at your assistance if any problems should arise in the future.
    <li> All of our dogs 
    have been spayed/neutered, received vaccines, are micro-chipped and have a clean bill of health.</li>
    <li>Dogs entering our organization are allowed time to decompress so we are able to accurately see the
         temperament of the dog prior to placing them available for adoption.</li>
